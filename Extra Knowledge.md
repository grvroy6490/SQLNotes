## Why it is (n*m) if we used primary key value to be a string column like email?

When we say the time complexity of a string comparison is _O(n)_, we're referring to comparing two individual strings, where _n_ is the length of the string. However, the time complexity of operations in a database context, such as searching or joining tables using a string-based primary key like an email, involves additional factors.

### Context in Databases:
* **String as a Primary Key:** If you use a string like an email as a primary key, the time complexity of searching for a record based on this key depends on two main factors:
  - **The Length of the String (n):** The time complexity to compare each string (email) is _O(n)_, where _n_ is the length of the email string.
  - **The Number of Records (m):** The time complexity also depends on the number of records _m_ in the database or the number of comparisons that need to be made.
 
### Why O(n * m)?
When performing operations like searching, inserting, or joining using a string-based primary key, the time complexity can become _O(n * m)_ for the following reasons:
* **Search Complexity:** 
  - If the database needs to search for a specific email in an unindexed dataset (a full table scan), it may need to compare the email with every record.
  - This involves _m_ comparisons, each taking _O(n)_ time, leading to _O(n * m)_ in the worst case.
 
* **Join Operations:** 
  - In join operations between two tables where the primary key is a string (e.g., email), the time complexity can be _O(n * m * k)_ where _k_ is the number of records in the second table.
  - For each of the _m_ records in one table, a comparison of length _n_ might be required with each of the _k_ records in the other table.
 
### Indexing Consideration:
* **Indexed Search:** If the email column is indexed (e.g., using a B-tree or hash index), the search complexity is generally reduced to _O(log m)_ or _O(1)_ for finding the matching record. However, the comparison for each match still involves _O(n)_, making the overall complexity for search operations _O(n * log m)_ or _O(n)_ in the best case.

### Summary:
* **Without Indexing:** The time complexity can be _O(n * m)_ when performing operations like searching or joining on a string-based primary key across _m_ records, where _n_ is the length of the string.
* **With Indexing:** Indexing can improve the search part, but the string comparison component remains _O(n)_, making the overall complexity _O(n * log m)_ in some cases.

This _n * m_ complexity reflects the combination of the number of records and the length of the strings being compared.

## String comparison component remains O(n) how, explain with example.

The time complexity of string comparison remains _O(n)_ because each character in the string must be compared until either a mismatch is found or the end of the string is reached. Here's a step-by-step explanation with an example.

### Example:
Consider two strings:

* string1 = "john.doe@example.com"
* string2 = "john.smith@example.com"

### Step-by-Step Comparison:
* Character-by-Character Comparison:
  - The comparison starts from the first character of both strings.
  - First, compare _'j'_ in both strings. They match.
  - Next, compare _'o'_. They match.
  - Continue comparing _'h', 'n', '.', 'd', 'o',_ and _'e'_. All match.

* Mismatch Detected:
  - When the comparison reaches _'d'_ in string1 and _'s'_ in string2, it detects a mismatch.
  - The comparison stops as soon as the mismatch is detected.

* Total Comparisons:
  - The number of comparisons made before detecting the mismatch is 8 (the length of the prefix "john.doe").

### Complexity Analysis:
* Worst-Case Scenario:
  - If string1 and string2 were identical, the comparison would continue until the end of the strings, making n comparisons, where n is the length of the strings.
  - In this example, if the strings were **"john.doe@example.com"** and **"john.doe@example.com"**, the comparison would continue for all 20 characters, resulting in 20 comparisons.

* Time Complexity:
  - **Best Case:** _ùëÇ(1)_ if the first character differs (e.g., **"a@example.com"** vs. **"b@example.com"**).

  - Worst Case: _O(n)_ if the strings are identical or differ only at the last character (e.g., **"john.doe@example.com"** vs. **"john.doe@example.co"**).


### Why is it O(n)?
* **Sequential Comparison:** The algorithm must check each character in sequence. The number of comparisons made is directly proportional to the length of the string. Hence, the time complexity is linear, or _O(n)_, where _n_ is the length of the string.

### String Comparison in a Database Context:
When a database performs an operation like a search or join on a string column (e.g., email), it might have to compare the query string with each candidate string in the database:

* Example:
  - Searching for "john.doe@example.com" in a table where the primary key is an email.
  - For each email in the table, the database needs to perform the comparison.
  - If there are _m_ records, and the length of each email is _n_, the string comparison for each email will take _O(n)_, and doing this for _m_ records results in a total complexity of _O(n√óm)_ in the worst case.

### Summary:
* The string comparison process involves checking each character one by one, leading to a time complexity of _O(n)_, where _n_ is the length of the strings being compared.
* In a database, when strings are used as primary keys, this string comparison component affects the overall time complexity of operations involving searches or joins, especially when dealing with large datasets.

## How does the comparison between long is way better than comparison of string?

The comparison between integers (like _long_) is generally more efficient than the comparison of _strings_. This is due to the fundamental differences in how numbers and strings are represented and processed in a computer. Here's why integer comparisons are more efficient:

### 1. Fixed Size vs. Variable Size

   * **Long (Integer) Comparison:**
     - _long_ values are of fixed size, typically 64 bits (8 bytes).
     - The comparison of two _long_ values involves a single operation because the CPU can directly compare the binary representation of the two numbers in a fixed amount of time, regardless of their value.
     - **Time Complexity:** _O(1)_, because the comparison involves a constant-time operation.

   * **String Comparison:**
     - _Strings_ are variable in length, meaning the number of characters can vary from one string to another.
     - To compare two strings, each character must be compared sequentially, starting from the first character.
     - **Time Complexity:** _O(n)_ in the worst case, where n is the length of the string, because the comparison may need to examine each character in the string.

### 2. Number of Operations

   * **Long (Integer) Comparison:**
     - Requires a single comparison operation, which is directly handled by the processor.
     - Example: Comparing _1234567890123456789L_ with _9876543210987654321L_ is done in one operation.
  
   * **String Comparison:**
     - Requires multiple comparison operations, one for each character in the strings until a difference is found or the end of the strings is reached.
     - **Example:** Comparing _"john.doe@example.com"_ with _"john.smith@example.com"_ involves comparing each character until the first difference is detected.

### 3. Memory and Cache Efficiency

   * **Long (Integer) Comparison:**
     - _long_ values occupy a small, fixed amount of memory (8 bytes), which makes them more cache-friendly.
     - The entire value can be loaded into a single CPU register, making the comparison fast.

   * **String Comparison:**
     - _Strings_ can be much larger and occupy more memory.
     - Large strings might not fit entirely in the CPU cache, leading to additional memory accesses, which can slow down the comparison.

### 4. CPU Instructions

   * **Long (Integer) Comparison:**
     - Modern CPUs have specialized instructions for comparing integers, which can be executed very efficiently.
     - The CPU can compare two long values directly with a single instruction.

   * **String Comparison:**
     - The CPU has to perform a loop to compare each character in the strings, which involves multiple instructions for each character comparison.

### Summary:
   * Integer Comparisons (like comparing long values) are inherently more efficient because they involve a single, fixed-size operation that is directly supported by the hardware. The comparison is done in constant time _O(1)_.
   * String Comparisons are less efficient because they involve comparing multiple characters sequentially, leading to a time complexity of _O(n)_, where n is the length of the string. This makes string comparisons slower, especially for long strings.

### Practical Implication in Databases:
   * Using integers (like _long_ values) as primary keys is generally faster and more efficient than using strings (like _email_ addresses). This efficiency becomes especially important in large databases where millions of comparisons might be necessary for operations like searching, sorting, and joining tables.
